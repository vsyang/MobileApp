# Overview

I am creating a flashcard Mobile App that allows users to create and study custom flashcards. The users can enter their own questions and answers that are stored as flashcards. Once they've added their cards, they can begin the quiz where a random card is shown, and tapping it flips the card to reveal the answer.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

Some things that I could fix in the future:

- Better visual design
- Get rid of or utilize the second screen
- Have an option where user can have different sets of flashcards
